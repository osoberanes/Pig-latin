# Pig-latin
Practice exercise to improve pseudocode habits and documentation

#Objective
To form pig latin, you take an English word that begins with a consonant, move that consonant to the end, and then add “ay” to the end. 
If the word begins with a vowel, you simply add “way” to the end. 
A popular word is “ixnay on the ottenray”
Write a program that takes a word as input and uses indexing and slicing to return its Pig Latin equivalent.

#What am I doing this for
I'm doing this easy project to practice the process around coding. Preparing the project, writing pseudocode and documenting the project.
